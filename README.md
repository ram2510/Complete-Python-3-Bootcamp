# Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp
Resourses for learning python 3 please install juypter notebook for viewing the course file

## Download Juypter notebook:-
You can download the jupyter notebook as a conda package if you have conda installed(it's pre loaded with the anconda distribution but not with the miniconda distribution) use the command in your conda pompt *conda install jupyter notebook* this should succesfully download the notebook

Now to run the jupyter notebook type 
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
in your conda prompt 


## Download Python3:-
I made all of my projects using python3, it will be replaced in the future by its succesor but I belive the changes in the syntax will be minimal so if you have python version other than 3.X look out for changes in my code
